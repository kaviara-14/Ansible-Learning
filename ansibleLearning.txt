1.passwordless authentication(ssh -keygen)
    get the public key of the ansible server and paste it in the target server's authorised key to do a password less authentication.
    with that we can do shh for all the server

    Access target server: shh <private Ip>

2. Ansible Adhoc commands - use it for single line or 2 line commands in CLI
    playbooks - multi line commands

3. create a Inventory file - add all the target Ip address in the Inventory

4. print all the ip address : 

cmd : ansible -i inventory all

5. create a file in all the target server

cmd : ansible -i inventory -m "shell" -a "touch firstFile"
cmd : ansible -i inventory -m "shell" -a "df"

6.grouping of server
vim inventory

[web server]
90.12.3.13
123.53.2.1

[db server]

34.12.3.3

cmd : ansible -i inventory web server -m "shell" -a "touch newfile"

7. install and start nginx in all the server

vim kavi.yml

---
- name : install and start nginx
  hosts : all
  become : root

 tasks:
    - name: install nginx
        apt:
            name: nginx
            state : present
    
    -name: start nginx
        services:
            name: nginx
            state: started

cmd to run : ansible-playbook -i inventory kavi.yml

debug : -v (verbose)

18. Ansible Roles
Efficient way to right complex playbooks - we can segergate and seperate

cmd : ansible-galaxy role init kubernetes
